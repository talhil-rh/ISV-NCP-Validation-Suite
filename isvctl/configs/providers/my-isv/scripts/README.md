# my-isv scaffold

Copy-and-fill-in scripts for adding your own platform to the validation suite.

Each script ships with a TODO block and two behaviors:

- **Default run** - exits with `"Not implemented - ..."`, making it obvious where to fill in your platform's API calls.
- **Demo mode** (`ISVCTL_DEMO_MODE=1`) - returns dummy-success JSON so the whole pipeline runs end-to-end without any cloud. Used by `make demo-test`.

## The three pieces that make this work

```text
suites/*.yaml                    <- contract   (what to validate; platform-agnostic)
                  │
                  ▼ imported by
providers/my-isv/config/*.yaml   <- wiring     (which scripts implement each step)
                  │
                  ▼ invokes
providers/my-isv/scripts/<domain>/*.py  <- scaffold   (generated for you; fill in TODO blocks)
```

The `suites/` layer is the validation contract - you never modify it, you
`import:` it from your provider config. Generate a provider scaffold from this
template, then fill in the TODOs.

The `k8s/` and `slurm/` examples drive a **real** cluster (validations shell out
to `kubectl` / `sinfo`), so they are not part of `make demo-test` — a
dummy-success stub has nothing to return for them.

See [`suites/README.md`](../../../suites/README.md) for the per-step / per-field breakdown.

## Usage

**1. Preview the pipeline with no cloud (~10s):**

```bash
make demo-test
```

**2. Generate the scaffold and wiring under your provider name:**

```bash
uv run isvctl provider scaffold acme
```

Use `--dry-run` to preview the destination and next commands, or `--output-dir`
to generate outside `isvctl/configs/providers/`.

**3. Implement each script** - each has a `TODO:` block with pseudocode and a link to the AWS reference implementation.

**4. Run for real (no demo flag):**

```bash
# A platform suite - the obligation attached to declaring that capability
uv run isvctl test run --provider acme --suite vm

# A plain suite: core checks by default, capability-gated checks when you name one
uv run isvctl test run --provider acme --suite storage
uv run isvctl test run --provider acme --suite storage --capability vm

# Or point at the config file directly - the same capability rule applies
uv run isvctl test run -f isvctl/configs/providers/acme/config/vm.yaml
```

Add `--dry-run` to any of these to list what would run and what would be
skipped, without executing a thing.

### Which checks run

Checks in a plain suite declare what they presuppose. `requires: []` (core) runs
in every context; `requires: [kubernetes]` runs only under
`--capability kubernetes`; `requires: [vm, bare_metal]` is any-match — either
context satisfies it. A plain suite with no `--capability` runs its core checks.

The same applies to your steps: if a step builds or destroys a fixture only some
contexts need, gate it so a core run neither provisions nor leaks it. Both halves
of a fixture take the same gate — see `config/storage.yaml`, where
`setup_cluster` and `teardown_cluster` are both `requires: [kubernetes]`.

Nothing is mandatory. A check is in scope only if you declared the suite holding
it, so 100% is always relative to what you declared.

## Private provider repositories

You do not need to contribute your provider scripts back to this repository,
Today `isvctl` runs provider configs by path: this repository supplies the
CLI, validation suites, and validation code; your private repository supplies
the provider `config/` and `scripts/` files.

Generate the scaffold directly into the private provider repository path you
intend to keep:

```bash
git clone <ai-cloud-validation>
cd ai-cloud-validation
uv sync

uv run isvctl provider scaffold acme --output-dir ../isvctl-provider-acme
```

Then initialize or connect that generated directory to your private Git repo
and implement the scripts there:

```bash
cd ../isvctl-provider-acme
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:acme/isvctl-provider-acme.git
# implement scripts/*
```

Run the private provider from the validation suite checkout by passing its
config path:

```bash
cd ../ai-cloud-validation
uv run isvctl test run -f ../isvctl-provider-acme/config/vm.yaml
```

Current limitation: out-of-tree provider YAML assumes you run `isvctl` from
the validation suite checkout root. Suite imports and shared scripts use paths
relative to that checkout; provider-owned scripts stay relative to the generated
provider `config/` directory.

## Anatomy of a script

Every Python script in this tree follows the same shape - this is what you're
copying:

```python
DEMO_MODE = os.environ.get("ISVCTL_DEMO_MODE") == "1"

def main() -> int:
    args = parser.parse_args()
    result = {"success": False, "platform": "<domain>", ...}

    # ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
    # ║  TODO: Replace with your platform's API calls         ║
    # ║  Example (pseudocode):                                ║
    # ║    client = MyCloudClient(region=args.region)         ║
    # ║    ...                                                ║
    # ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

    if DEMO_MODE:
        # dummy-success values so make demo-test passes
        result["success"] = True
        result[...] = ...
    else:
        result["error"] = "Not implemented - replace with your platform's ... logic"

    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
    return 0 if result["success"] else 1
```

Keep the output field names in the documented contract - the validations
read specific keys (`instance_id`, `state`, `public_ip`, etc.). The AWS
reference implementation is the source of truth for what "correct" output
looks like.

For bare-metal serial console validation, the scaffold must also prove that
historical console logs are queryable for the required retention window. Emit
`console_log_queryable`, `retention_days_configured`,
`oldest_queryable_log_age_days`, `query_result_count`, and `retention_evidence`
from a real serial console log archive or retention policy query.
