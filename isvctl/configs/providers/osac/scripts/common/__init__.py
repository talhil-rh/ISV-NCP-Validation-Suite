"""Shared Python utilities for OSAC provider scripts.

Every OSAC script reaches this package via a single ``sys.path`` entry -
``providers/osac/scripts/`` - so ``from common.osac_client import ...``
resolves without any namespace-package juggling. Modules:

- ``osac_client``: Keycloak admin + Fulfillment Service client helpers
  using only Python stdlib (``urllib.request``).
