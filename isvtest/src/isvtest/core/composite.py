"""Composite checks: one named validation assembled from generic ones.

Several generic checks often add up to a single thing an operator cares about -
"the IAM user was created with usable credentials" is a step that succeeded
*and* an output carrying the expected fields. Wiring those as separate checks
spends two catalog names on one idea and leaves the second one holding a
``test_id: "N/A"``.

A composite gives that idea its own name, description, and ``test_id``, and
names the generic checks that implement it::

    IamUserCreatedCheck:
      test_id: "IAM01-01"
      labels: ["iam"]
      requires: []
      description: "Check the IAM user is created with usable credentials"
      compose:
        - StepSuccessCheck
        - FieldExistsCheck:
            fields: ["username", "access_key_id"]

The composite is one catalog entry and one pytest test; its members run as
subtests, so a failure still says which part broke.
