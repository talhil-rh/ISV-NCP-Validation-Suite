"""Tenant-transition data-sanitization validations (requirement SEC21/SEC22).

Four provider-agnostic checks that assert a cloud does not hand a host to a
new tenant until it has been sanitized since the previous tenancy:

- ``BmMemorySanitizationCheck`` (SEC21-04): host (RAM) memory is sanitized
  between tenants.
- ``BmGpuMemorySanitizationCheck`` (SEC21-05): GPU/SRAM memory is sanitized
  between tenants (scoped to GPU-equipped hosts).
- ``BmFirmwareResetCheck`` (SEC21-06 / SEC22): TPM is cleared and BIOS/UEFI is
  recommitted during tenant transitions or hardware replacement.
- ``BmDiskSanitizationCheck`` (SEC21-02): storage/disk is sanitized on delete, so
  a prior tenant's on-disk data cannot leak to the next tenant.

All four share one provider-neutral signal: a host that has served a tenant
must pass through a dedicated *sanitizing* lifecycle stage before it becomes
allocatable to a new tenant again. The check inspects the host's recorded
state ``transitions`` and fails a host that went from ``in_use`` back to
``available`` without an intervening ``sanitizing`` stage, or that is offered
to new tenants while still bound to a prior tenant. They only inspect the
provider-neutral JSON a step script emits, so any provider that maps its
host lifecycle into the documented fields can reuse them.

The disk and memory checks gate on the same lifecycle signal: on platforms
like NICo a single between-tenant sanitizing stage performs RAM cleanup,
NVMe/HDD secure erase, the UEFI memory-overwrite check, InfiniBand cleanup,
and TPM/BIOS reset together, and a host is only returned to the allocatable
pool once that whole stage (including storage secure-erase) succeeds -- a
failed storage clean keeps the host out of the pool. So at the host-lifecycle
granularity these checks observe, storage sanitization on delete is confirmed
by the same gate; they remain separate test IDs per the requirements they map
to. A full low-level disk-remnant probe (write a marker, release, reallocate,
re-read the raw device) is out of scope for this lifecycle audit.
