"""Hardware/firmware attestation validations (requirements SEC22 / CNP09).

Two provider-agnostic checks that assert a cloud's bare-metal hosts establish a
hardware root of trust. They are modelled on the two attestation subsystems a
GPU cloud control plane (e.g. NVIDIA's NICo / infra-controller) actually runs:

- ``BmNonceAttestationCheck`` (SEC22-01): each host passes a *fresh* nonce-based
  device attestation. This mirrors NICo's **SPDM device attestation**, where the
  verifier issues a random nonce, the device's root of trust (GPU/CPU/BMC ERoT)
  returns signed evidence over that nonce, and a verifier (NRAS) checks it. The
  host passes when the nonce challenge is satisfied (``nonce_verified`` -- proves
  liveness, not a replay) and the returned evidence signature verifies
  (``attestation_signature_valid``).
- ``BmFirmwareAttestationCheck`` (CNP09-02): all firmware is cryptographically
  signed and its measurements are attested during boot. This mirrors NICo's
  **Measured Boot**, where firmware/bootloader/kernel measurements are extended
  into TPM PCRs during boot and verified against a golden bundle. The host passes
  when secure boot is enabled (``secure_boot_enabled`` -- firmware signatures
  enforced, PCR 7) and the boot measurements were attested against the expected
  golden values (``boot_measurements_attested``).

Both only inspect the provider-neutral JSON a step script emits (one record per
host), so any provider that maps its attestation surface into the documented
fields can reuse them. A host that does not support/expose attestation
(``attestation_supported`` false) fails -- the requirement is that the hardware
*passes* attestation.
